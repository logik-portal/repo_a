## Description

Take a path, either Windows or POSIX, and extract part of the path using tokens.
Useful for converting windows paths to POSIX for Flame, or even paths from other
machines that just have different mount points.

Example paths this was tested on below.
<br><br>
windows path no trailing slash
J:\dir\dir\dir\dir\_dir\000000
<br><br>
frankenstein path with posix slashes and windows mount
J:/dir/dir/dir/dir/dir/dir/dir-dir/file_file_file_file-file_v000.mov
