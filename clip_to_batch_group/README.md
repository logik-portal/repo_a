<br><br>
self.go_to_batch = False

Additional naming can be added to the end of batch group names. Edit the following line
in the __init__ section. Naming must be in quotes.
<br><br>
self.additional_naming = '_comp'

Names of the batch group reels that are created by default can be
changed by editing these two lists in the __init__ section:

schematic_reel_list = [
'Elements',
'Plates',
'PreRenders',
'Ref',
]
<br><br>
shelf_reel_list = [
'Renders',
