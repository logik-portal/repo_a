                all_item_paths - Return the recursive paths of all items in the PyFlameTreeWidget.

        PyFlameGridLayout:
            Added the ability to set the number of columns and rows in the grid to make it easier to place widgets especially where space is desired between widgets.
            By default the unit size of the grid is 150px wide and 28px high. The size of a normal button. The width and height of each grid unit along with the
            number of columns and rows can be adjusted using setGridSize method.

            Added new arguments:
                columns - Set number of columns in the grid. Default is 0.
                rows - Set number of rows in the grid. Default is 0.
                column_width - Set width of each column in the grid. Default is 150.
                row_height - Set height of each row in the grid. Default is 28.

            Removed the following arguments:
                setMinimumColumnWidth - No longer needed.
                setMinimumRowHeight - No longer needed.

            Added new method:
                setGridSize - Configure the grid layout dimensions and cell sizes. This method allows you to:
                    - Set the number of columns and rows in the grid
                    - Define the width of each column (in pixels)
                    - Define the height of each row (in pixels)
                    - Automatically adjust spacing between grid cells

                    This makes it easier to create precise layouts, especially when you need consistent spacing
                    between widgets or want to reserve empty cells in your grid.

        PyFlameWindow/PyFlameDialogWindow
            Simplified window creation by adding PyFlameGridLayout to the window by default with optional
            arguments to set the number of columns and rows along with column and row widths. This can
            be overridden by passing grid_layout=False.

            Added new arguments:
                tab_width - Set the width of tab name label
                tab_height - Set the height of the tab name label
                grid_layout - Set to True to use the default grid layout. Default is True.
                grid_layout_columns - Set the number of columns in the grid layout. Default is 4.
                grid_layout_rows - Set the number of rows in the grid layout. Default is 3.
                grid_layout_column_width - Set the width of each column in the grid layout. Default is 150.
                grid_layout_row_height - Set the height of each row in the grid layout. Default is 28.
                grid_layout_adjust_column_widths - Set the width of specific columns in the grid layout. Default is {}.
                grid_layout_adjust_row_heights - Set the height of specific rows in the grid layout. Default is {}.

        PyFlameMessageWindow:
            Updated message printing to terminal to be more clear.
            Message text no longer uses html tags such as <b> or <br>. Text is now printed as plain text.

        PyFlameProgressWindow:
            Updated message printing to terminal to be more clear.

        Deprecated pyflame functions:
            message_print - Use pyflame.print instead.
            resolve_path_tokens - Use pyflame.resolve_tokens instead.

        Deprecated widgets:
            PyFlameLineEdit - Use PyFlameEntry instead.
            PyFlameLabel.Style.BACKGROUND - Use PyFlameEntry with read_only=True instead.

        Miscellaneous:
            max_width argument is now set to True by default for all widgets. width and height are
            now bypassed. This means the widgets will now expand to fill the available space. The
            size of the widgets is now determined by the layout(PyFlameGridLayout, PyFlameHBoxLayout,
            PyFlameVBoxLayout). To override this behavior, set max_width to False and set width and height
            arguments to set the size of the widget.

            max_height argument is now set to True by default on the following widgets. The above behavior for
            max_width applies to max_height.

            (Default: `PYFLAME_FONT_SIZE`)

        `tooltip` (str, optional):
            PyFlameSlider tooltip text.
            (Default: `None`)

    Methods:
    --------
        `get_value()`:
            Return the PyFlameSlider value as an integer or float.

    Examples:
    ---------
        To create a PyFlameSlider:
        ```
        slider = PyFlameSlider(
            start_value=0,
            min_value=-20,
            max_value=20,
            )
        ```

        To return the PyFlameSlider value as an integer or float:
        ```
        slider.get_value()
        ```

        To return the PyFlameSlider value as a string:
        ```
        slider.text()
        ```

        To enable/disable PyFlameSlider:
        ```
        slider.setEnabled(True)
        slider.setEnabled(False)
        ```

        `username_password()` -> Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str]]:
            Returns the entered username and password as a tuple or (None, None) if no username or password was entered.

    Notes:
    ------
        For messages with multiple lines, use triple quotes for message text.

    =============

    Custom QT Flame Window Widget

    Creates a custom QT window with a colored bar on the left side of the window.

    By default, the window will have a grid layout with 4 columns and 2 rows.
    This can be overridden by setting the `grid_columns` and `grid_rows` arguments.
    If `grid_layout` is set to `False`, the window will not have a grid layout and a layout
    will need to be added in the main script.

    Args:
    -----
        `title (str)`:
            Text displayed in top left corner of window.
            (Default: `Python Script`)

        `width (int)`: Set minimum width of window.
            (Default: `150`)

        `height (int)`: Set minimum height of window.
            (Default: `30`)

        `line_color (LineColor)`: Color of bar on left side of window.
            (Default: `LineColor.BLUE`)

        LineColor Options:
        - `LineColor.GRAY`: For gray line.
        - `LineColor.BLUE`: For blue line.
        - `LineColor.RED`: For red line.
        - `LineColor.GREEN`: For green line.
        - `LineColor.YELLOW`: For yellow line.
        - `LineColor.TEAL`: For teal line.

        `return_pressed (callable, optional)`: Function to be called when return key is pressed.
            (Default: `None`)

        `tab_width` (int):
            Set width of window tab labels.

        `tab_height` (int):
            Set height of of window tab labels.

        `grid_layout` (bool):
            Add grid layout to window.
            (Default: `True`)

        `grid_columns` (int):
            Number of columns in grid layout. Only used if `grid_layout` is `True`.
            (Default: `4`)

        `grid_rows` (int):
            Number of rows in grid layout. Only used if `grid_layout` is `True`.
            (Default: `3`)

        `font (str)`: Font to be used in window.
            (Default: `PYFLAME_FONT`)

        `font_size (int)`: Size of font.
            (Default: `PYFLAME_FONT_SIZE`)

    Methods:
    --------
        `add_layout(layout)`:
            Add layout to window.

    Notes:
    ------
        - For proper sizing of widgets and placement of widgets in the window,
        be sure to set the correct number of columns and rows in the grid layout
        when using the default grid layout.

    Example:
    --------
        To create a window using the default grid layout:
        ```
        window = PyFlameWindow(
            title=f'{SCRIPT_NAME} <small>{SCRIPT_VERSION},
            return_pressed=confirm,
            grid_columns=6,
            grid_rows=5,
            )

        window.addWidget(some_widget1, row=0, column=0, row_span=1, column_span=1)
        window.addWidget(some_widget2, row=0, column=0, row_span=1, column_span=1)
        window.addWidget(some_widget3, row=0, column=0, row_span=1, column_span=1)
        ```

        To create a window not using the default grid layout:
        ```
        window = PyFlameWindow(
            title=f'{SCRIPT_NAME} <small>{SCRIPT_VERSION},
            return_pressed=confirm,
            grid_layout=False,
            )

        create some widgets here...

        layout = PyFlameVBoxLayout()

        layout.addWidget(some_widget1, row=0, column=0, row_span=1, column_span=1)
        layout.addWidget(some_widget2, row=0, column=0, row_span=1, column_span=1)
        layout.addWidget(some_widget3, row=0, column=0, row_span=1, column_span=1)

        window.add_layout(layout)

        window.show()
        ```
